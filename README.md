# Second-Hand-Car-Price-Prediction:
The objective of the "Second-hand Car Price Prediction" project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the price of second-hand cars based on various features and specifications of the vehicles.
# Motivation:
Determining whether a used car is priced fairly when browsing online listings can be challenging. Numerous factors, such as mileage, make, model, year, and condition, can significantly affect a car's true value. For sellers, pricing a used car accurately presents a similar dilemma. To address this challenge, the goal is to leverage machine learning algorithms to create predictive models that estimate used car prices based on available data.
# Tools Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- IDE/Environment: Jupyter Notebook
